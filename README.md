# Robots

Trying and model the real world in code.

> Your are a developer inside a robot factory. Your task is to manage robot settings. Here are the rules:
>
> * When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.
>
> * The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated in the format
>   of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.
>
> * Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
>   which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will
>   respond with a new random name.
